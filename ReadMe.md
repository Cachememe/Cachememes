Welcome to Cachmemes GitHub Repro,

the project is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python (with the Django Framework) and is in active development. 

The current state is more for demo pruposes. Project will be updated soon.  


You can copy paste the code and do whatever you want with it as long your Project (Application/Website and or Services etc.) are not commercial and will not be at any point in the future. If your prject is commercial (includes Ads, sells anything, tries to earn money in general), please write me an E-mail at Info@cacheme.me and ask for permission to use the code.
